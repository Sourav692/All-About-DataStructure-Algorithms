    "    Write a function that takes in a non-empty string and returns its runlength encoding.\n",
    "    From Wikipedia, \"run-length encoding is a form of lossless data\n",
    "    compression in which runs of data are stored as a single data value\n",
    "    and count, rather than as the original run.\" For this problem, a run of\n",
    "    data is any sequence of consecutive, identical characters. So the run\n",
    "    \"AAA\" would be run-length-encoded as \"3A\" .\n",
    "\n",
    "    To make things more complicated, however, the input string can\n",
    "    contain all sorts of special characters, including numbers. And since\n",
    "    encoded data must be decodable, this means that we can't naively\n",
    "    run-length-encode long runs. For example, the run\n",
    "    \"AAAAAAAAAAAA\" (12 A s), can't naively be encoded as \"12A\" ,\n",
    "    since this string can be decoded as either \"AAAAAAAAAAAA\" or\n",
    "    \"1AA\" . Thus, long runs (runs of 10 or more characters) should be\n",
    "    encoded in a split fashion; the aforementioned run should be\n",
    "    encoded as \"9A3A\" .\n"
