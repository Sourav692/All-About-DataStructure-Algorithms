    "One approach to solve this problem is to attempt to create every single amount of change,\n",

    "Hint 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Start by sorting the input array. Since you're trying to find the minimum amount of change\n",

    "\n",
    "To understand the trick to this problem, consider the following example:\n",
    "coins = [1, 2, 4] . With this set of coins, we can create 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\n",

    "Hint 4\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a variable to store the amount of change that you can currently create up to. Sort all\n",
    "of your coins, and loop through them in ascending order. At every iteration, compare the\n",
    "current coin to the amount of change that you can currently create up to. Here are the two\n",
    "scenarios that you'll encounter:\n",
    "\n",
    "    The coin value is greater than the amount of change that you can currently create plus 1.\n",
    "    The coin value is smaller than or equal to the amount of change that you can currently create plus 1.\n",
    "In the first scenario, you simply return the current amount of change that you can create\n",
    "plus 1, because you can't create that amount of change. In the second scenario, you add the\n",
    "value of the coin to the amount of change that you can currently create up to, and you\n",
    "continue iterating through the coins.\n",
    "The reason for this is that, if you're in the second scenario, you can create all of the values of\n",
    "change that you can currently create plus the value of the coin that you just considered. If\n",
    "you're given coins [1, 2] , then you can make 1, 2, 3 cents. So if you add a coin of\n",
    "value 4 , then you can make 4 + 1 cents, 4 + 2 cents, and 4 + 3 cents. Thus, you\n",
