    "This problem follows the Sliding Window pattern, and we can use a similar dynamic sliding window strategy as discussed in Longest Substring with K Distinct Characters. We can use a HashMap to remember the last index of each character we have processed. Whenever we get a duplicate character, we will shrink our sliding window to ensure that we always have distinct characters in the sliding window."

This also means K<=N , because in the worst case, the whole string might not have any duplicate character, so the entire string will be added to the HashMap. Having said that, since we can expect a fixed set of characters in the input string (e.g., 26 for English letters), we can say that the algorithm runs in fixed space O(1) ; in this case, we can use a fixed-size array instead of the HashMap."
